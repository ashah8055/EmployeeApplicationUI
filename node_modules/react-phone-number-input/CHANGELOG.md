2.2.9 / 30.09.2018
==================

  * Added `.react-phone-number-input--focus` CSS class. [Issue](https://github.com/catamphetamine/react-phone-number-input/issues/189).

2.2.0 / 03.08.2018
==================

  * Changed the output of `AsYouType` formatter. E.g. before for `US` and input `21` it was outputting `(21 )` which is not good for phone number input (not intuitive and is confusing). Now it will not add closing braces which haven't been reached yet by the input cursor and it will also strip the corresponding opening braces, so for `US` and input `21` it now is just `21`, and for `213` it is `(213)`.

2.1.8 / 27.07.2018
==================

  * Lowered React requirements back to `0.14` (same as for version 1.x of this library).

2.0.0 / 17.07.2018
==================

  * (breaking change) `/native` is now the default export. `react-responsive-ui` select is now exported as `react-phone-number-input/react-responsive-ui`.

  * (breaking change) Migrated `react-responsive-ui` country select from `0.10` to `0.13`. It no longer has text input functionality (like "autocomplete") — it's just a `<select/>` now, without any text input field. Removed `rrui.css` file (use `react-responsive-ui/style.css` bundle instead, or import styles individually from `react-responsive-ui/styles`). Renamed `maxItems` property to `scrollMaxItems`. Removed `countrySelectToggleClassName` property (unused).

  * (breaking change) `smartCaret` is now `false` by default (previously was `true`). This was done because some Samsung Android phones were having issues with `smartCaret={true}` (which was the default in version `1.x`). `smartCaret` has been removed for now, so that it doesn't include `input-format` library code.

  * (breaking change) `international` property is now `true` by default meaning that by default there will always be the "International" option in the country `<select/>`.

  * (breaking change) CSS changes: renamed `.react-phone-number-input__phone--native` CSS class to `.react-phone-number-input__phone`, added new `.react-phone-number-input__input` CSS class (the phone input).

  * (breaking change) Removed undocumented exports.

  * (breaking change) For `/custom` component `labels` and `internationalIcon` properties are now required (previously were `react-phone-number-input/locales/default.json` and  `react-phone-number-input/commonjs/InternationalIcon` by default).

  * (breaking change) Removed `/resources` directory (due to not being used).

1.1.13 / 12.07.2018
===================

  * Added `react-phone-number-input/basic-input` component.

1.1.3 / 29.05.2018
===================

  * Some CSS tweaks and code refactoring.

1.1.2 / 29.05.2018
===================

  * Added an isolated `react-phone-number-input/native` export (so that it doesn't include `react-responsive-ui` package in the resulting bundle).

  * Some CSS tweaks.

  *  `countrySelectComponent` `onToggle` property renamed to `hidePhoneInputField`.

1.1.0 / 28.05.2018
===================

  * Added `PhoneInputNative` exported component which deprecateds the old `nativeCountrySelect={true/false}` property. `PhoneInputNative` component doesn't require `rrui.css`. It will be the default exported component in version `2.x`.

  * Fixed [a minor bug](https://github.com/catamphetamine/react-phone-number-input/issues/131) appering in React 16.4 which caused the currently selected country flag to be reset while typing.

1.0.10 / 19.04.2018
===================

  * Added an optional `smartCaret={false}` property for [fixing Samsung Android phones](https://github.com/catamphetamine/react-phone-number-input/issues/75).

1.0.8 / 19.04.2018
===================

  * (breaking change) Changed the properties passed to a custom `inputComponent`, see `Input.js` `propTypes` for more info.

  * Added `BasicInput`: an alternative `inputComponent` for working around the Samsung Galaxy caret positioning bug.

1.0.0 / 21.03.2018
===================

  * (breaking change) Rewrote `Input.js` — there is a possibility that something could potentially break for users coming from previous versions.

  * (breaking change) No longer exporting `libphonenumber-js` functions.

  * (breaking change) `dictionary`'s `"International"` key renamed to `"ZZ"`.

  * (breaking change) `dictionary` property renamed to `labels`.

  * (breaking change) `nativeExpanded` property renamed to `nativeCountrySelect`.

  * (breaking change) `selectTabIndex` property renamed to `countrySelectTabIndex`.

  * (breaking change) `selectMaxItems` property renamed to `countrySelectMaxItems`.

  * (breaking change) `selectAriaLabel` property renamed to `countrySelectAriaLabel`.

  * (breaking change) `selectCloseAriaLabel` property renamed to `countrySelectCloseAriaLabel`.

  * (breaking change) `selectComponent` property renamed to `countrySelectComponent`

  * (breaking change) `flagComponent`'s `countryCode` property was renamed to just `country`.

  * (breaking change) Renamed `countries with flags.js` to `flags.js` and put them in the root folder.

  * (breaking change) `flags` property changed: it can no longer be a `boolean` and can only be an object of flag `React.Component`s.

  * (breaking change) `selectStyle` and `inputStyle` properties removed (due to not being used).

  * (breaking change) `inputTabIndex` property removed (use `tabIndex` instead).

  * (breaking change) `onCountryChange` property removed (no one actually used it).

  * (breaking change) `convertToNational` property renamed to `displayInitialValueAsLocalNumber`.

  * (breaking change) `style.css` changed a bit (to accomodate phone number extension field).

  * (breaking change) If someone did override `.rrui__input:not(.rrui__input--multiline)` CSS rule then now it has been split into two CSS rules: `.rrui__input` and `.rrui__input--multiline`.

  * Added `locale`s for the `labels` property (`ru` and `en`).

  * Added `ext` property for phone number extension input.

0.17.0 / 24.02.2018
===================

  * (breaking change) Fixed SVG flag icons for IE. This alters the markup a bit: `<img/>` is now wrapped in a `<div/>` and the CSS class of the image becomes the CSS class of the div and also a new CSS class for the image is added. This could hypothetically be a breaking change in some advanced use cases hence the major version bump.

  * Fixed `<Select/>` scrolling to the top of the page in IE <= 11.

  * Fixed validation error margin left.

0.16.0 / 22.02.2018
===================

  * Updated `libphonenumber-js` to `1.0.x`.
  * `parsePhoneNumber()`, `isValidPhoneNumber()` and `formatPhoneNumber()` no longer accept `undefined` phone number argument: it must be either a `string` or a parsed number `object` having a `string` `phone` property.

0.15.0 / 10.10.2017
===================

  * Added `error` and `indicateInvalid` properties for displaying error label.

  * (CSS breaking change) `react-phone-number-input` `<div/>` is now wrapped by another `<div/>` and its CSS class name changed to `react-phone-number-input__row` and `react-phone-number-input` CSS class name goes to the wrapper.

0.14.0 / 04.10.2017
===================

  * Returning `<input/>` `type` back to `tel`. There used to be reports previously that `input="tel"` `<input/>`s on some non-stock Android devices with non-stock keyboards had issues with proper caret positioning during input. Well, those are non-stock Android bugs and therefore they should fix those there. `type="tel"` is better in terms of the digital input keyboard so it's now a default. Still can be overridden by passing `type="text"` property.

0.13.0 / 20.09.2017
===================

This release contains some minor CSS class names refactoring which most likely won't introduce any issues in almost but all use cases.

(CSS breaking change) Refactored `<Select/>` CSS class names in `react-responsive-ui`:

  * `.rrui__select__selected--autocomplete` -> `.rrui__select__autocomplete`

  * `.rrui__select__selected` -> `.rrui__select__button`

  * `.rrui__select__selected--nothing` -> `.rrui__select__button--empty`

  * `.rrui__select__selected--expanded` -> `.rrui__select__button--expanded`

  * `.rrui__select__selected--disabled` -> `.rrui__select__button--disabled`

(CSS breaking change) Added `.rrui__text-input__input` CSS class to the phone number `<input/>`.

(CSS breaking change) Added global `.rrui__text-input__input` styles to `style.css`

0.12.1 / 27.07.2017
===================

  * Due to the [reports](https://github.com/catamphetamine/react-phone-number-input/issues/59) stating that `type="tel"` caret positioning doesn't work on Samsung devices the component had to revert back to `type="text"` by default (one can pass `type="tel"` property directly though).

0.12.0 / 25.07.2017
===================

  * (breaking change) The default value of `convertToNational` property changed from `true` to `false`. The reason is that the newer generation grows up when there are no stationary phones and therefore everyone inputs phone numbers with a `+` in their smartphones so local phone numbers should now be considered obsolete.

0.11.3 / 16.05.2017
===================

  * Now alphabetically sorting the supplied custom country names

0.11.2 / 12.05.2017
===================

  * Fixed a bug when `value` was not set to `undefined` when the `<input/>` value was empty
  * Added `selectMaxItems` property for customizing the country select height

0.11.0 / 03.05.2017
===================

  * (CSS breaking change) Removed vertical padding from the first and the last `<Select/>` `<li/>` options and moved it to `.rrui__select__options` `<ul/>` itself. So if someone customized `.rrui__select__options-list-item:first-child` and `.rrui__select__options-list-item:last-child` vertical padding then those padding customizations should be moved to `.rrui__select__options` itself.
  * (CSS breaking change) Added `.rrui__select__option:hover` and `.rrui__select__option--focused:hover` background color for better UX.

0.10.0 / 18.04.2017
===================

  * (might be a breaking change) Slightly refactored the component CSS improving it in a couple of places along with adding comments to it (see `style.css`).
  * Added country code validation.

0.9.1 / 16.04.2017
==================

  * (breaking change) Moved the `.css` file to the root folder of the package and **split it into two files** (the `rrui` one is not required when already using `react-responsive-ui`). `import`ing the CSS file via Webpack is the recommended way to go now.
  * (breaking change) Vendor prefixes dropped in favour of manually using autoprefixers.

0.8.10 / 15.04.2017
===================

  * Added support for externally changing `value` property

0.8.5 / 06.04.2017
==================

  * Added `inputTabIndex` and `selectTabIndex` settings

0.8.5 / 05.04.2017
==================

  * Added `nativeExpanded` setting for native country `<select/>`

0.8.1 / 27.03.2017
==================

  * The `.valid` property has been removed from "as you type" formatter, therefore dropping the `.react-phone-number-input__phone--valid` CSS class. This doesn't affect functionality in any way nor does it break existing code therefore it's a "patch" version upgrade.

0.8.0 / 17.03.2017
==================

  * (could be a breaking change) Moving CSS positioning properties from inline styles to the CSS file therefore if using an edited CSS file from older versions (when not doing it via Webpack `require(...)`) update styles for `.rrui__select` and `.rrui__select__options`. As well as `.rrui__expandable` and `.rrui__shadow` have been added. Maybe (and most likely) something else, so better re-copy the entire CSS file.

0.7.11 / 16.03.2017
===================

  * Fixed a small bug when an initially passed phone number `value` wasn't checked for country autodetection
  * A small enhancement: when an international phone number is erased to a single `+` then the currently selected country is reset. And, analogous, when a country is selected, and the input is empty, and then the user enters a single `+` sign — the country is reset too.

0.7.9 / 12.03.2017
==================

  * Fixed a small bug when the `country` property was set after page load programmatically and that caused the input taking focus (which displayed a keyboard on mobile devices)

0.7.5 / 22.02.2017
==================

  * `@JeandeCampredon` fixed `Const declarations are not supported in strict mode` in module exports

0.7.1 / 28.01.2017
==================

  * Added custom metadata feature (now developers have a way to reduce the resulting bundle size in case they decide they need that)
  * `lockCountry` property removed (use `countries={[country]}` instead)
  * Added `international` boolean property to explicitly indicate whether to show the "International" option in the list of countries
  * Not showing country `<Select/>` when `countries.length === 1` or `countries.length === 0`
  * `countries` property can now only be an array of country codes

0.6.13 / 28.01.2017
===================

  * Fixed the flags bug introduced by adding `flags={ false }` option

0.6.12 / 27.01.2017
===================

  * Added `flags={ false }` option

0.6.11 / 26.01.2017
===================

  * Added `lockCountry` option
  * Added a possibility to specify `countries` as an array of country codes
  * Fixed country selection on `country` property update

0.6.8 / 03.01.2017
===================

  * Optimized performance on mobile devices

0.6.6 / 30.12.2016
===================

  * Added a bunch of CSS classes: `react-phone-number-input`, `react-phone-number-input--valid`, `react-phone-number-input__country`, `react-phone-number-input__phone`, `react-phone-number-input__phone--valid`

0.6.5 / 28.12.2016
===================

  * Now hiding the phone input while the country select is open

0.6.1 / 24.12.2016
===================

  * Fixed collapsed select options being interactive in iOS 8 Safari

0.6.0 / 23.12.2016
===================

  * A complete rewrite. Now supports all countries, all formats are hard-coded from Google Android's `libphonenumber` library.

0.5.4 / 11.12.2016
===================

  * Hong Kong phone numbers fix by @nchan0154

0.5.3 / 15.11.2016
===================

  * Added some popular country formats (and stubs for other countries)
  * Small bug fix for trunk prefixed phone numbers

0.5.0 / 14.11.2016
===================

  * `format` prop is now not required for the React component. If `format` is not specified then the input switches itself into "auto" (iPhone style) mode.
  * input code rewrite

0.4.0 / 15.09.2016
===================

  * (breaking change) `digits` passed to the `template()` function don't include trunk prefix anymore
  * Introduced custom `valid(digits)` phone number validation function for phone number format

0.3.0 / 07.09.2016
===================

  * `format_phone_number` (aka `formatPhoneNumber`) function now formats phone number internationally (with country code) if no `format` argument was supplied (it tries to autodetect the correct phone number format from the phone number itself)

  * Added `country(phone)` function

  * Added `country_from_locale(locale)` (aka `countryFromLocale(locale)`) function

0.2.11 / 06.09.2016
===================

  * Added `parse_phone_number` (aka `parsePhoneNumber`) function

0.2.10 / 04.09.2016
